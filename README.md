Echoes of Joy – SongMaker is a versatile music creation tool for musicians and composers. It allows users to build songs by defining structure blocks (e.g., verse, chorus, bridge), selecting root notes and scales (including major, minor, and modal options), and adjusting parameters like tempo, time signature, and emotional feel (e.g., happiness, tension). It supports importing/exporting, printing, and offers a randomized mode for creative inspiration. This makes it ideal for experimenting with song structures and tonal variety, catering to both novice and experienced musicians.
